ESATracker: Expert-Supervised Asymmetric Visual Tracker for Space Noncooperative Target

In recent years, active visual tracker of space noncooperative targets based on deep reinforcement learning has made great progress, which can use a vision camera to accurately track different types of targets. However, there is still great room for improvement in the learning efficiency and tracking performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an expert-supservised asymmetric visual tracker, ESATracker, which adopts asymmetric actor-critic framework and privileged expert tracker to learn optimal tracking policy. In order to better evaluate the real performance of tracker, we present the second version of space noncooperative object active tracking benchmark, SNCOAT-V2, which introduces more realistic target models and more baseline algorithms. The experiments implemented on SNCOAT-V2 benchmark show that our method achieves the most efficient learning process and the highest tracker performance, compared to those baseline trackers. In addition, the effectiveness and reliability of ESATracker is also proven by sufficient ablation study.

Code will be available soon ...
